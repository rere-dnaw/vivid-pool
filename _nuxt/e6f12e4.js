The concept of the block chain showed all of us new \n      possibilities and solutions to problems created by the digital \n      age. Inspired by that we decided to be a part of the decentralization \n      movement. The two projects about which we are mostly excited are \n      Cardano and Polkadot. They are the best example of the last 12 \n      years of progress which have been made in block chain technologies.\n    ",rafal:"\n      I'm a 29 years old software tester/developer with over 5 years of \n      experience in a field.
